###Introduction
(G)it Depends seeks to build a flexible and powerful game creation and playing environment.  This environment will be founded upon a flexible game engine, and a comprehensive game-authoring environment.  The game engine will be able to can interpret and run a wide array of games with different actors, rules, and goals.  The authoring environment will provide an extremely broad amount of flexibility to allow users to create actors and levels with as few limitations pre-defined parameters as possible.  The games created will be run through an easy-to-use and intuitive game player, which will contain a library of previously created games for the user to choose from.  The primary design goals of (G)it Depends are to provide users the most flexibility possible in creating robust, complex games.  

The primary architecture of our design lies in the idea that games can be constructed of Sprites, Conditions, Effects, and Attributes.  A Sprite is anything that appears on the game screen when the game is played, ranging from a soldier, to a tower, to a menu.  Sprites, and the global state of the game, possess Attributes.    Attributes are numerical values that can be used to represent a broad variety of various aspects of Sprites or the global state of the game.  For example, Attributes could represent ammunition remaining for a rifleman, the number of lives the user has remaining, or health.  Effects define how the Sprites interact with each other and the game state, primarily via numerical operations on Attribute values.  Some examples of effects would be decreasing the value of health, moving on the screen, or removing a Sprite from the screen entirely.  Conditions define when Sprites impose effects on one another and the game state.  Together Effects and Conditions define the “rules” for the game.  The game engine will interpret and run games based on these assumptions and the game-authoring environment will allow the user to create games utilizing these objects.  

(G)it Depends has chosen to focus it’s efforts on building an environment suited for Tower Defense games.  There are many unique aspects to the Tower Defense genre as a whole that our environment will need to support.  First off, Tower Defense games allow for the user to modify the state of the level by placing towers and actors on the screen to aid in their defense.  Therefore the state of the game’s level needs to be extremely dynamic.  Tower Defense also depends on waves of enemies moving in a random fashion towards an objective, and conversely having the defense actors and towers be “smart” enough to destroy as many of those enemies as they can in an intelligent fashion.  Finally Tower Defense games are grounded in strategy, so there needs to be a great deal of flexibility in how a user can accomplish reaching the winning condition of a level.




###Overview



###User Interface

When designing our user interface, we wanted something both simple for the user and well designed from us. Though our engine may be able to support very complex interactions, our game authoring environment and game player will present the game in an easy to use way. Our game authoring environment (shown below) is separated into a few tabs. There are three "main" tabs that can bring the user to define the main 3 parts of the game: the general game information, characters & objects, and the levels. To keep with the Model View Controller design paradigm, each "sub part" of the authorship will have its own view and controller, independent of the others. In the first tab, for general game information, the user will be able to define basic things about the game like title, author, and certain rules. The second tab will have multiple forms for creating objects of the game like global/character attributes (health, money, etc), enemies, defenders, obstacles and interactions. Each form will look the same way and inherit from the same interfaces. The basic layout will be a list on the left that will show previously created items and a form on the right where the user can create a new item. The list will show the previously created items in a presentable way. For example, for enemies and defenders, it would show a "cell" with the picture, name and description of the enemy. The form is made out of subforms to make it modular. For example, enemies and game attributes would both have a "Profile" subform to fill out the name, description, and photo. And, if the user ever wants to go back and edit a created item, he/she just has to click on the cell in the list and the form will be auto-populated with information. Then, he/she can click "Save" or "Delete" for the item. The interactions also work in the same way as this, except the form is more dynamic. To create an action, the user will specify a sprite, then a condition, then an action that occurs. Because there's a complex tree of interactions that can happen, the subforms will be generated algorithmically. For example, if the user wanted to define an action that ended the game, no more information is needed. But, if the user wanted to define an action that damages an enemy, the user would need to specify what enemies and how much damage.

In the last main tab, there will be the forms to create levels (shown below). On the top will be tabs to represent the created levels, and a "+" tab to add a new one. Each level will have a background image to upload to represent the general scene. On the right hand side, there will be a series of drop down lists to select and drag different items created from the previous slide like enemies, defenders, and terrain. These can be dragged onto the scene to be placed into the level. Additionally in this pane, there will be an option to drag "spawners" onto the screen. These are invisible sprites that can generate new enemies as actions. The user will get to specify what enemies are generated from that spawner and a path for enemies to follow from that spawner. On the bottom are two other tiles. The first is the "Waves" section. This is where the user can create different waves of enemies very easily by specifying which enemies, the number of them and how fast they come. Multiple waves can be created for a level. The second tile is the "Win/Lose Condition" section. This is where the user should specify how the game either ends or continues. Each is presented in an "If ____ is ____ then win/lose". This way, the user can specify very complex game ending conditions and they can be different for each level.

The game player is actually quite a simple interface for the user and will follow nicely from the game authoring environment. The top of it has a menu bar to do certain control actions like save the game, switch to editing, or choose a new game. Then in the middle is the actual game view. The center has the level view, where the action occurs. This is where towers and defenders are dropped and the game animates. Above this is the HUD, which is dynamic based on the game. It at least displays the user info and the score. Additionally, it will show any global attributes of the game created by the user like lives, mana, or money. On the right hand side is the sprite picker. This is where the user can drag and drop any selectable sprite onto the game map. Note that we are not restricting what can be in that picker, but it is up to the user to define. This will almost be exactly like the right tile of the level creation tab in the authorship environment. The sprites will be draggable and there may be a series of drop down lists to group things.

###Design Details



###Design Considerations 



####Engine Sub-team Meetings

Over the course of our meetings, the strongest ambiguities and concerns we attempted to address were collision detection, how to classify events or effects in regards to our sprites, and numerous nuances about how the engine would handle clicks and user-input, changing levels, and access management. 

During our initial conversations, we discussed how we wanted to handle the notion of attributes. At first, we discussed maintaining private instance variables that serve as generic attributes such as health and movement. Focusing on generalizing the notion of attributes, we introduced the notion of an external condition manager. These conditions essentially maintain the information involving the sprites or group of sprites, the effect, and any global attributes that may be altered. 

In regards to a few design patterns, we discussed trade-offs between the strategy design pattern and a combination of the composition and visitor pattern to handle how we implement the notion of behavior. We decided that we wanted unilateral dependencies that moved downwards from the game to each individual sprite. We believe this prevented any untraceable altercations that occur if we pass references up the hierarchy and wait for it to trickle back down. We decided to run with the composition design pattern with sprites to attach various modules, such as weapons or movement. 

Additionally, we are strictly adhering to interfaces for our sprites, modules, conditions, and components of the engine. During one of our meetings, we heavily discussed our hierarchy beginning with the player and moving down at a high-level into the game engine and the components below the engine component. We discussed tradeoffs on how we want to pass condition and collision information between our managers, the level, and the sprites and its attributes. We decided that we would create a condition and collision manager that holds a list of all of the users' effects and events for that level. By doing so we would be able to prevent passing information up to the level and back down to the sprites. Our solution holds the affected sprites attributes, a list of effects, a method to check if the condition or collision is met, and where else the condition needs to be applied.

We also held significant discussion about the notion of a level and how we would differentiate what a level and a splash screen entails. We defined splash screens as interstitial screens with texts and bottoms that allow the user to segue between levels. The problems that elucidated from this discussion created issues with our model. We didn't feel comfortable having a renderer in our game engine that rendered Sprites onto the screen and text and buttons. We didn't want to abstract the renderer to account for the differences because we would introduce complications between our level manager and how the authoring environment would create the notion of a splash screen. 


####Authoring Sub-team Meetings

On the authorship side, there are still a few issues that need to be addressed before we finish our basic implementation. First, we need to make very clear our hierarchy of model-view-controllers for the game authorship. Making multiple model-view-controllers will be quite tricky and we had a very lengthy discussion about whether the view has the controller or the controller has the view or neither. We decided that each view should have a controller that works independently of any other controller. We felt this best separated JavaFX code and normal code. Also, since the model is just the one created by the engine, we will just use that one instead of making our own.

The other issue that was discussed at length was how to deal with dynamic forms to create objects, and especially interactions. Because interactions vary widely and some take values and some don't, this created a complex 'tree' quite similar to SLogo. We discussed whether supporting these dynamic forms was worth the trouble (it would make the controller quite complex too) or if we should give one standard form for everything. We decided that we should not be limiting the user's choice, so we will have to come up with a way to reveal different sub forms and parse the information accordingly. So, we will try to use sub forms like in the other creation tabs, but these just aren't always there.

Lastly, we have not discussed validation among the authoring environment yet. Meaning, there is no current plan for how we will monitor forms being filled out correctly or if the game is ready to be saved to an XML. Though this will probably just mean adding in functionality to our form controllers and overall controller, it's still a discussion that may need to be had.

####Overall Considerations

Going forward, the discussions we are having entail input from both sub-groups. One of the topics we are discussing is the notion of paths for sprites and our interpretation of spawners. Additionally, we are going to have to deliberate on how we the authoring environment constructs the XML files and how the engine team uses reflection and other techniques to interpret the property files for the specified game. 

On the authorship side, there were some design conversations that occurred because we didn't yet have created classes yet in the engine. I think once we have a more concrete idea of some of the objects that are being created (like mover or firing modules), these discussions will end. Understanding how to store form and sub-form data is a problem we are tackling on the authoring environment. We need to abstract an appropriate way to interpret sprite information, wave or level information, and data about winning conditions.
