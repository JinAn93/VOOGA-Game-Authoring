# Project Plan

In our approach to completing this project, at least at this early stage, we have decided to split into two roughly defined frontend and backend times.  The frontend team is tasked with carrying out the design and implementation for the GameAuthoring environment and display aspects of the Game Player itself and the backend team is tasked with construction and design of the Game Engine and XML data management.  In terms of basic implementation, we plan to implement a functioning program that allows users to customize, design and play a basic game of tower defense genre.  This will include customizing graphics, defining towers and weapons (including graphic, movement strategies, behavior, and collisions), defining terrain appearance and physical properties, defining level progression and win conditions, and other such basic game features.  For the extension, we are planning to add a number of additional features including the ability to define character upgrades, define specific wave characteristics within each level, incorperate AI engines in character movements, dynamically edit game attributes on the fly, define character upgrade properties such as stat boosts, and upload and share user information through facebook (utility), and other such complex feature implementation.
